# DOTFILEs 
The intention of this repository is to provide repeatable configuration of environments that I use for development with minimal setup time.
The plan is to create multiple sub-folders based on they type of environment that I'm configuring and have scripts and configuration files for each of these. 
These scripts will provide the means to quickly setup various environment types and could be used on Virtual Machines, WSL, Chrome Linux environments, and direct computers.
If I pull any scripts from existing repositories for ideas I will make note of the origins for those scripts at that time.
